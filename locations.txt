Welcome to Vobarts Library. Shttt ! Don't distub the students : go east for food court or south to leave this building.
You are currently in the middle of the second floor room at Vobarts, TofU's biggest library. Everyone is watching you,
completely lost as you just appeared here. Don't be scared, take a deep breath and tell yourself that these people are
all NPCs. Whenever you feel enough courage to embrace this adventure, you can either enter the food court by the East,
or just go South to leave this library full of dangerous people. In both cases, remember that you meticulously have to
choose where to go in that game. Indeed, as far as I know, you are not Hulk or any other 9 feet giant with infinite
stamina. Unfortunately, you will be limitated to 50 moves. Enough said, get ready for a crazy ride around Taranta !

Already hungry ? Good because you are in the food court ! Go South to join Saint Andrew and Nuron streets intersection.
I knew you were going to come here, what else can you do when you smell these delicious burritos ! Grab some, take a
sit and enjoy this quick break. Don't stay here for too long tho, you can end up spending the entire day eating this
amazing food right there. Whenever you finish your burrito, throw the paper in the trashcan and go South to join the
Saint Andrew and Nuron streets intersection.

You are in front of Vobarts Library. Head toward the East to join Saint Andrew and Nuron streets intersection.
You are right in front of the amazing Vobarts Library. Did you notice that the architect tried to imitate the shape of a
Chicken when designing it ? The food trucs right next to you are unfortunately closed, you will have to walk a bit on
towards the East to join Saint Andrew and Nuron streets intersection. Be careful with the red lights, many cars often
go way over the speed limit.

Nuron and Saint Andrews street intersect here! Follow the south to go to Melbourne Smith or East for Quadrity College.
**Vrrrrroooooooommmm**, wow that was close ! You almost got hit by a car but you will eventually get used to this
adrenaline if you always come here. The sky is getting dark because of the clouds... Do not stay here or you will
probably get lost in the giant TofU campus. You can either go South towards Melbourne Smith, a Science and Arts faculty
building, or go East to join the super old Quadrity College on Nuron Street. If I were you, I would probably have chose
East as the lights are brighter than sun light but who am I after all ? Why would you listen to my advices ?

You are currently in front of Quadrity College. Go South to go to front campus fields or East to join King's Park.
Quadrity College, some say that you can find ghosts and witches in that building! Thankfully, Quadrity is closed this
week for the exams. I would have never adventured myself inside that scary building depite it being beautiful. After
taking all your time to admire that edifice, you will either go South in what's front campus or keep going East towards
King's Park.

Welcome to King's Park! You can either go North to see VictoriaSecret College or South for Einstein library.
Kings'park, I wish you were here in September, that time when the sky was still blue... However, you will still enjoy a
super cozy walk in that incredible landscape surrounded by some small hairy and creepy friends : squirrels. Do not try
to feed them ! Even though they look cute, some of them are dangerous and can bite! Once you will have completed a full
tour of that park, you can either go North to see VictoriaSecret College or South for Einstein library. Remember where
is this park because trust me, you will want to come back.

This is VictoriaSecret College ! If you want to enter the building, you will find a small door on the East direction.
Stunned is probably the word that would best describe your feelings in front of that dazzling building ! At first, I
thought it looked like a cartoon or a sort of bakery. Do not spend too much time staring at this building, you have to
sit an exam soon and you can't be late. It is getting dark, if I were you, I would not waste my time entering here.
What else do you expect to find apart from some old books ? But again, why would you even trust me...

You are inside VictoriaSecret College, you can leave by the first exit on the West.
You are inside VictoriaSecret College, the perfect place to chill out after your exam tonight. Take a look at that
chandelier right above your head, isn't it amazing ? I don't know when and how did they hang it up there but the only
thing I can be sure about is that at that pace, you will probably miss your exam. You have to move quicker ! You will
find the exit door right behind you, in the West side.

Here is Melbourne Smith building. Go South to get to the TofUBookStore or go East to visit CollegeUniversity.
You just arrived to Melbourne Smith building. This is where you had some of your math classes and were taking notes
thanks to your pencil (eye wink). For the exam you will sit tonight, I hope this will give you memories about all the
concepts you learnt here. Do you remember all the cookies you got from ThirdCup in Melbourne Smith's hall ? Do not get
lost in the corridors, a lot of people find themselves desoriented by that maze. If you really want to, have a look
around and then head towards South if you want to go to the TofU's Bookstore or go East to join CollegeUniversity.

Welcome to TofU's Bookstore ! You better go back North as the only other option is to go up by the West door.
Welcome to TofU's Bookstore ! Here, you can find more books and TofU's Merch as well as all the textbooks you obviously
scrutinized to prepare for the exam of tonight. Don't forget to buy TofU's hoodies for your friends, they will love it !
*strange noise*... Did you hear this ? This was coming from the West door. Some rumors say that a monster is living in
the BookStore ! If I were you I would not adventure myself, we never know what can happen ! You can leave by the same
door you entered, in the North. But again, why would you even listen to my advices ? Some monsters can be nice...

You are on TofU's Rooftop. Hop in the helicopter that can take you to the South or go back downstairs by the East door.
You made it on top of the Bookstore ! The noises were in fact a helicopter landing on the building. Oh look ! The pilot
seems to be calling you ! He is saying that he has a nice gift for you. Remember what your parents told you... Never say
yes to strangers... Is it finally time to make an exception to this rule ? Who would not want a free helicopter ride
above Taranta ? If you feel ready to embrace that adventure, go South to enter the helicopter. If you are scared to be
late for tonight's exam, feel free to go back by the East door. Take the right decision because exactly like the
helicopter, time is flying...

You are on top of the PN Tower ! Drake is sitting right there and has a special surprise for you !
You just landed on the tallest building of North America : the PN Tower ! Strangers sometimes have nice surprises for
you! *Someone is shouting your name*... Look who is sitting right there ! It's Taranta most famous singer, Drake !
Take a selfie with him and tell him about your exam tonight, he might be able to help you...
